# Bug Fixes and Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Episode Merging Bug ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: When merging episodes from Firebase Storage with database episodes, storage episodes that didn't exist in the database were not being added to the final list.

**Root Cause**: The logic was checking if episodes existed in the database but not properly adding them to the merged list.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the merging logic in `AnimeDetailViewModel.mergeEpisodes()`
- Added proper logging to track the merging process
- Ensured all storage episodes are included in the final list

```kotlin
// Before (Buggy)
storageEpisodes.forEach { storageEpisode ->
    val existsInDb = dbEpisodes.any { it.episodeNumber == storageEpisode.episodeNumber }
    if (!existsInDb) {
        // This was not being executed properly
    }
}

// After (Fixed)
storageEpisodes.forEach { storageEpisode ->
    val existsInDb = dbEpisodes.any { it.episodeNumber == storageEpisode.episodeNumber }
    if (!existsInDb) {
        // Add storage episode to merged list
        mergedEpisodes.add(storageEpisode)
        Log.d("AnimeDetailViewModel", "Added storage episode ${storageEpisode.episodeNumber} that wasn't in database")
    }
}
```

### 2. Media Player Navigation Panel Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: 
- Navigation panel didn't hide properly during video playback
- Full-screen mode wasn't working correctly
- Player controls were not responsive

**Root Cause**: 
- ExoPlayer configuration was incomplete
- Full-screen state management was not properly implemented
- Missing proper UI state handling for full-screen mode

**Solutions**:

#### A. Improved ExoPlayer Configuration
```kotlin
PlayerView(context).apply {
    player = exoPlayer
    playerView = this

    // Configure player view for better UX
    useController = true
    showTimeoutMs = 3000 // Hide controls after 3 seconds
    showBuffering = PlayerView.SHOW_BUFFERING_WHEN_PLAYING
    
    // Enable double tap to seek
    setOnTouchListener { _, event ->
        // Handle touch events for better UX
        false
    }
}
```

#### B. Enhanced Full-Screen Mode
```kotlin
// Dynamic height based on full-screen state
.height(if (isFullScreen) 400.dp else 280.dp)

// Hide UI elements in full-screen mode
if (!isFullScreen) {
    // Show episode info overlay
    // Show control buttons
    // Show progress bar
}
```

#### C. Proper State Management
```kotlin
// Update player state when isPlaying changes
update = { playerView ->
    if (isPlaying) {
        exoPlayer?.play()
    } else {
        exoPlayer?.pause()
    }
    
    // Update player view configuration
    playerView?.let { view ->
        view.useController = true
        view.showTimeoutMs = 3000
        view.showBuffering = PlayerView.SHOW_BUFFERING_WHEN_PLAYING
    }
}
```

### 3. Episode Persistence Issue ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Episodes found in Firebase Storage were only added to the merged list for display but were not being saved to the database for persistence.

**Root Cause**: The logic was not properly saving episodes found in storage to the database.

**Solution**: Added a new method `saveStorageEpisodesToDatabase()` in `AnimeDetailViewModel.kt` that:
- Identifies episodes found in storage that don't exist in the database
- Saves each new episode to the database using `dbRepository.updateEpisode()`
- Updates the anime record with the new episodes
- Provides detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

```kotlin
// Before (Buggy)
storageEpisodes.forEach { storageEpisode ->
    val existsInDb = dbEpisodes.any { it.episodeNumber == storageEpisode.episodeNumber }
    if (!existsInDb) {
        // This was not being executed properly
    }
}

// After (Fixed)
storageEpisodes.forEach { storageEpisode ->
    val existsInDb = dbEpisodes.any { it.episodeNumber == storageEpisode.episodeNumber }
    if (!existsInDb) {
        // Add storage episode to merged list
        mergedEpisodes.add(storageEpisode)
        Log.d("AnimeDetailViewModel", "Added storage episode ${storageEpisode.episodeNumber} that wasn't in database")
    }
}
```

### 5. Incorrect updateEpisode Function Implementation ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: The `updateEpisode` function in `DbRepositoryImpl.kt` was incorrectly implemented:
- Wrong parameter: Used `userId` instead of `animeId`
- Wrong collection: Tried to update `usersCollection` instead of `animeCollection`
- Wrong field path: Tried to update `"episodes.${episode.id}"` on user document
- Wrong purpose: Should add/update episodes to anime, not to user

**Root Cause**: The function was designed for updating user episodes instead of anime episodes.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the `updateEpisode` function to:
- Use correct parameter: `animeId: String` instead of `userId: String`
- Update correct collection: `animeCollection` instead of `usersCollection`
- Properly handle episode addition/update logic
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Sort episodes by episode number

**Files Modified**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/sukuna/animestudio/data/repository/DbRepository.kt` (interface signature)
- `app/src/main/java/com/sukuna/animestudio/data/repository/DbRepositoryImpl.kt` (implementation)

```kotlin
// Before (Incorrect)
override suspend fun updateEpisode(userId: String, episode: Episode): Boolean {
    return try {
        usersCollection.document(userId).update("episodes.${episode.id}", episode).await()
        true
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e("DbRepositoryImpl", "Error updating episode", e)
        false
    }
}

// After (Correct)
override suspend fun updateEpisode(animeId: String, episode: Episode): Boolean {
    return try {
        val animeDoc = animeCollection.document(animeId).get().await()
        if (animeDoc.exists()) {
            val anime = animeDoc.toObject(Anime::class.java)
            if (anime != null) {
                val existingEpisodes = anime.episodes.toMutableList()
                val existingIndex = existingEpisodes.indexOfFirst { it.episodeNumber == episode.episodeNumber }
                
                if (existingIndex != -1) {
                    existingEpisodes[existingIndex] = episode
                } else {
                    existingEpisodes.add(episode)
                }
                
                val sortedEpisodes = existingEpisodes.sortedBy { it.episodeNumber }
                animeCollection.document(animeId).update("episodes", sortedEpisodes).await()
                true
            } else {
                false
            }
        } else {
            false
        }
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e("DbRepositoryImpl", "Error updating episode for anime $animeId", e)
        false
    }
}
```
